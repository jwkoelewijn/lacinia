  A simple `Type` will document an object, input object, interface, union, or enum.

  The second form is used to document a field of an object, input object, or interface, or
  to document a specific value of an enum (e.g., `:Episode/NEW_HOPE`).

  The final form is used to document an argument to a field (it does not make sense for enums).

  Additionally, the `Type` can be `queries`, `mutations`, or `subscriptions`, in which case
  the `name` will be the name of the operation (e.g., `:queries/episode`).

  An exception is thrown if an element identified by a key does not exist.
